## Challenges Faced

One challenge I faced was displaying whether an item was saved or not in the database. Specifically, when opening the detail screen after refresh, I wanted to show a **filled or unfilled bookmark** icon to indicate if the item was already saved. I struggled with the logic at first, but after getting help from ChatGPT, I realized it was just a simple condition on top of what I had already built. Sometimes, the solution is easier than it seems!!!
